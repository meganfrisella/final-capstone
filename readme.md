# FridgeCop

## Summary
An Alexa-integrated system for detecting the users and contents of a fridge. 
A team-based project aimed to identify the user of a fridge via face recognition and detect what they add or remove via object detection and recognition. 
The Alexa-integrated system can be queried by voice to identify the user using voice recognition and report the items they own in the fridge and if any were taken.

## Functionality
* Fridge database stores a dictionary of people’s names and a list of the foods they currently have stored in the fridge.
* Tracks when foods are added or taken from the fridge via the Food Recognition Model.
* Recognizes whoever is accessing the fridge via the Face and Voice Recognition Model.
* Can catch food thieves if someone takes food that isn’t theirs. Decreases incentive to anonymously steal from the fridge.
* Fridge must be accessed through Alexa, the Fridge Cop. User is inevitably identified through voice while speaking to Alexa.
